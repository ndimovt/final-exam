I understood the condition as follows: I am asked to write a program processing football data and showing the two players who participated the longest in the championship (as duration) from different teams. 
When the program is initially run, tables are created in the database with relationships between them. 
Files are submitted with requests to specific endpoints. Data, format and lack of data if any are processed, validated.
If the submitted information meets the requirements, it is written to the database, if not, an appropriate message is displayed in postman. 
When entering a suitable endpoint, the two players who have participated in the championship for the longest time are visualized in postman with their names, the total duration and the team from which each of them belongs.
